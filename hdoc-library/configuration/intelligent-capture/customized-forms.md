As well as standard Capture forms that are provided with each app, Hornbill also provides the ability to create your own customized forms. With custom forms, you can create multiple questions of different field types for users and customers to answer during Intelligent Capture.

## Node Properties
### Custom Form
* **Custom Form Name**<br>The display name for the node on the intelligent capture designer.
* **Purpose**<br>A text field to record the purpose of the custom form (optional).

### Form Settings
* **Language**<br>A default language version of the custom form is provided, but you can opt to create different language versions of the custom form by selecting another available language and populating the labels, answers in different languages.
* **Form Id**<br>This is the unique identifier for the custom form, this can be used later to identify the answers to your questions when using the Hornbill Business Process Workflow engine. The Form Id must be at least 3 characters in length.
* **Form Prompt**<br>This is any text you wish to appear with the custom form to help identify it's purpose.
* **Never Skip Form**<br>Setting to True will ensure that this form is never bypassed in your capture flow, even if custom questions have default values set and the questions are not set to mandatory. This will ensure the user will always be presented with the form to at least validate the default choices, or change them if required.

### Form Fields
The form fields are the questions you wish to ask on the custom from.
* You can add new questions by selecting the 'add field button
* You can edit an existing question by selecting the note and pencil icon of an existing question
* You can delete an existing question by using the trash can icon of an existing question
* You can re-order how the questions will appear by using the up and down arrows to move the questions into the required order.

## Field Properties
Field properties are specific for each field / question you wish to add to your custom form. If you require the questions of the custom form to be available in more than the default english languages, use the Properties Language option to switch the configuration into the additionally required languages and set the values accordingly - these translated values will then be presented to the user dependent on the language set in their profile when viewing the custom form questions.

There are various field options and setting and these are explained below.

* **Field Id**<br>This is the unique id for the question on the custom form. This can normally be left, unless you are wanting to map the answer from this question to a custom field on a request, where a field mapping needs to be given. Read about field mappings. The Field Id must be at least 3 characters in length.
* **Label**<br>This will be the label used to represent the question on the custom form.
* **Description**<br>You can use this field to provide hints / tips or advice on how to complete the answer to this specific question.

### Field Flags

* Give the condition a name and choose options such as `This field will be visible on the form`
* Using the `If the following is true` option to add conditions under which this field will be shown / hidden, this can be based on a combination of values (answers) to other questions (fields) on the same or previous capture forms. Select apply Settings when finished.
* It is possible to set multiple sets of Conditions under which a field may be shown. Simply add more conditions under the Override Flags tab using the Add new condition option
* Where multiple conditions are listed, these will be evaluated from the top down until a match is found, the evaluation will stop here and no further conditions will be checked.
* Complete the `Field Type Settings` options to define the attributes of the conditional field.
