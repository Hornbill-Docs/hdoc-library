# HDocBook documentation
This is an example of a simple static content documentation project that is compatible with the Hornbill Docs system

Make sure that you have installed hdoc-tools   

  npm install hdoc-tools -g

To preview the documentation in a browser, you can open a terminal window and run the dev preview server with the 
command `hdoc serve`. When the local server is running, in a local browser navigate to the URL: `http://localhost:3000`
